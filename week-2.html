                <h2>Workshop Activity:<br> Paper Prototyping</h2>
                <p>
                    <h3>Week Overview & What We Did</h3><br><br>
                    This week, we explored paper prototyping as a rapid web development and UX testing tool.
                     The goal was to create a low-fidelity prototype of a website or simple game

                    <br>
                     Our process included:<br>
                     <ul>
                        <li>Understanding Paper Prototyping – Learning how it helps in UI/UX design.</li>
                        <li>Creating a Paper Prototype – Designing a simple website by assembling paper cut outs.</li>
                        <li>User Testing – Conducting a cognitive walkthrough with peers to refine the design.

                        </li>
                     </ul>
                </p>
                <h2>Step 1: Measuring the Web </h2>
                <p>
                    We started with Pixact.ly, an online tool that tests our ability to estimate pixel dimensions. 
                    This exercise helped us understand how elements scale on a digital screen, which is useful for designing UI layouts.
                </p>
                <h2>Step 2: Creating a Paper Prototype</h2>
                <p>
                    We were then assigned to sketch a website using paper prototyping techniques.<br> The prototype needed to represent:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> Layout structure (navigation, buttons, content sections)</li>
                    <li>User interactions (clicks, scrolls, transitions)</li>
                    <li>Basic functionality (what happens when the user performs an action)</li>

                <h2>Workshop Activity 2: "Make It Bling"</h2>
                <p>
                    <h3>Week Overview & What We Did</h3><br><br>
                    This workshop focused on rapid ideation, wireframing, and styling web pages using CSS. 
                    We explored how to create visually engaging designs and improve user experience through consistent styles, 
                    colors, and assets.

                    <br>
                     Our process included:<br>
                     <ul>
                        <li>Crazy Eights – Generating 8 quick design ideas in 8 minutes.</li>
                        <li>Wireframing & Sketching – Choosing one idea and refining it.</li>
                        <li>Live Coding Demo – Learning how to use CSS classes, grids, and animations.

                        </li>
                     </ul>
                </p>
                <h2>Step 1: Crazy Eights</h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Crazy Eights technique to brainstorm design ideas. In this exercise:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> We sketched one idea per minute for 8 minutes.</li>
                    <li>The focus was on speed and creativity rather than perfection.</li>
                    <li>At the end, we pinned up and discussed our ideas.</li>
                 </ul>

                <p>
                    We learned how to enhance our designs with CSS styling. Key topics covered:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>  Using CSS Classes & Styles for Consistency</li>
